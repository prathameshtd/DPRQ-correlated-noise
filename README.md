# DPRQ-correlated-noise

Code for cascade sampling algorithm in the paper [Differentially Private Range Queries with Correlated Input Perturbation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07066)



+ 'cascade.py' contains the main sampling algorithm to generated correlated gaussian noises.

+ 'comparison.py' compares the cascade sampling algorithm with scipy's built-in function for correlation matrix generated using 'corr_matrix.py'.
